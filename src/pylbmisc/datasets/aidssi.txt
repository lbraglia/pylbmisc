     These data sets give the times (in years) from HIV infection to
     AIDS, SI switch and death in 329 men who have sex with men (MSM).
     Data are from the period until combination anti-retroviral therapy
     became available (1996). For more background information on the
     cohort, ccr5 and SI, see Geskus _et al._ (2000, 2003)

     ‘aidssi’ contains follow-up data until the first of AIDS and SI
     switch. It was used as example for the competing risks analyses in
     Putter, Fiocco, Geskus (2007) and in Geskus (2016).
