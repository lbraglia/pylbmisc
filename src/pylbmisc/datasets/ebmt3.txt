_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A data frame of 2204 patients transplanted at the EBMT between
     1995 and 1998. These data were used in Section 4 of the tutorial
     on competing risks and multi-state models (Putter, Fiocco &
     Geskus, 2007). The included variables are

     id Patient identification number

     prtime Time in days from transplantation to platelet recovery or
          last follow-up

     prstat Platelet recovery status; 1 = platelet recovery, 0 =
          censored

     rfstime Time in days from transplantation to relapse or death or
          last follow-up (relapse-free survival time)

     rfsstat Relapse-free survival status; 1 = relapsed or dead, 0 =
          censored

     dissub Disease subclassification; factor with levels "AML", "ALL",
          "CML"

     age Patient age at transplant; factor with levels "<=20", "20-40",
          ">40"

     drmatch Donor-recipient gender match; factor with levels "No
          gender mismatch", "Gender mismatch"

     tcd T-cell depletion; factor with levels "No TCD", "TCD"
