_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     A retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk
     region of the Western Cape, South Africa. There are roughly two
     controls per case of CHD. Many of the CHD positive men have
     undergone blood pressure reduction treatment and other programs to
     reduce their risk factors after their CHD event. In some cases the
     measurements were made after these treatments. These data are
     taken from a larger dataset, described in Rousseauw et al, 1983,
     South African Medical Journal.
